### Understanding Query Plans

#### Introduction
Consider a situation where a database query needs heavy optimization or there is an urgent need to complete the query quickly because management expects rapid results. The first step before executing such a query is addressing the query plan.

#### What is a Query Plan?
A query plan is a sequence of operations that the Database Management System (DBMS) will perform to retrieve the result of an SQL query. It is essential to understand how Oracle or any other DBMS executes these queries under the hood.

#### Types of Query Plans
1. **Explain Plan**: A potential execution plan generated before running the query.
2. **Execution Plan**: The actual plan executed by the DBMS.

#### Analogy
Imagine a taxi ride. The planned time and route are excellent for the current road conditions. However, as the journey begins, unforeseen factors like emergencies and scheduled work can arise. To shorten the path and avoid delays, the taxi driver may change the route. Similarly, the execution plan may differ from the explain plan due to real-time conditions.

#### Explain Plan vs. Execution Plan
In a well-designed system with an optimal load, the occurrence of emergencies is minimal, leading to almost no difference between the explain and execution plans. Therefore, in practice, they are often similar.

#### How to Generate an Explain Plan
1. **Using IDEs**: Tools like SQL Developer, DBeaver, etc., typically use hotkeys (e.g., F8 or F10) to generate an explain plan.
2. **Using DBMS Commands**: For example, using Oracleâ€™s `EXPLAIN PLAN` statement.

#### What an Explain Plan Shows
- Query execution order
- Data structures used
- Join algorithms
- Indexes applied
- Operations performed (sorting, aggregation, etc.)

#### Query Optimizer
The DBMS uses a query optimizer to explore various ways to execute the SQL query and choose the most optimal one. The optimizer may alter the query execution plan to ensure efficiency.

#### Practical Execution
In practice, there are several methods to obtain the execution plan:
1. **As mentioned in the slides**.
2. **Using DBMS tools and interfaces**.

### Conclusion
Understanding and addressing the query plan is crucial for optimizing database queries, especially under urgent conditions. By leveraging the explain plan and execution plan, along with the query optimizer, one can ensure efficient and effective query execution.
