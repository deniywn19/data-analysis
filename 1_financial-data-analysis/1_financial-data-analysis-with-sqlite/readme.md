## Cleaning & Reformat
1.  **Display Dataset Columns** : Use the following command to display all columns in the dataset

    ```sql
    PRAGMA table_info(financials);
    ```

      Fig.1. Table Info
    </p>
    
    The dataset contains the following columns:
    * segment, country, product, discount_band, unit_sold, manufacturing_price, sales_price, gross_sales, discount, sales, cogs, profit, date, month_number, month_name, year
2. **Display Sample Data in Columns**: Use the SELECT query to view a subset of the data in the dataset columns.
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Financials LIMIT 6;
    ```

      <kbd><img src="images/2_previewdata.png"> </kbd> <br>
      Fig.2. Preview Data
    </p>
    
    **Check Results**
    * several columns contain dollar signs, such as Unit Sold, Manufacturing Price, and Sale Price.
    * We need to remove the dollar signs from these columns. Additionally, we must convert these columns from text to float.

3. **Reformat Data** : Use the following SQL commands to update the necessary columns 
    ```sql
    UPDATE financials
    SET "Units Sold" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Units Sold", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT),
        "Manufacturing Price" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Manufacturing Price", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT),
        "Sale Price" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Sale Price", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT),
        "Gross Sales" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Gross Sales", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT),
        "Discounts" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Discounts", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT),
        "Sales" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Sales", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT),
        "COGS" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("COGS", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT),
        "Profit" = CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("Profit", '$', ''), ' ', ''), ',', '') AS FLOAT);

    ```
    **The Results** (use query select)

## Multivariat
1. **Discount impact on revenue Analysis** : Use the following SQL commands 
    ```sql
    SELECT
        "Discount Band",
        SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales,
        SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit,
        (SUM(Sales)/SUM(Profit)) AS Profit_Margin
    FROM Financials
    GROUP BY "Discount Band"
    ORDER BY Total_Profit DESC;
    ```

    <kbd><img src="images/8_discountimpactonrevenue.png"> </kbd> <br>
        Fig.8. Discount impact on revenue
    </p>
        
    #### **Output Overview**<br/>
    We have analyzed the sales performance based on different discount bands. The dataset contains the following columns:
    1. **Discount Band**: The level of discount applied to the products.
    2. **Total Sales**: The total sales revenue generated.
    3. **Total Profit**: The total profit earned.
    4. **Profit Margin**: The percentage of profit relative to sales.

    #### Interpretation of Results

    1. **Medium Discount Band**:
    - **Highest Total Sales**: Products with a medium level of discounts generate the highest sales.
    - **Insight**: Moderate discounts appeal to a broader customer base.

    2. **High Discount Band**:
    - **Second Highest Total Sales**: Attracts a good number of customers but is less effective than medium discounts.
    - **Insight**: High discounts might be applied to fewer products or attract more price-sensitive but less frequent customers.

    3. **Low Discount Band**:
    - **Lower Sales**: Smaller discounts are not as attractive to customers, leading to fewer purchases.
    - **Insight**: Customers are less motivated to buy with minimal discounts.

    4. **No Discount Band**:
    - **Lowest Sales**: Products without any discounts generate the least sales.
    - **Insight**: Customers expect or prefer discounts and are less inclined to purchase without them.

    #### Business Insights
    - **Effective Discount Strategy**:
    - **Medium Discount Band**: Most balanced and effective for generating high sales volume.
    - **High Discount Band**: Effective in driving sales but could lead to lower profit margins or be less sustainable.

    #### Testing Profit Margin Hypothesis
    - **Hypothesis**: High discounts result in lower profit margins.
    - **Test**: Replace total sales with total profit to see the effect of discount levels on profit.

    #### Results of Profit Margin Test
    - **Observation**: 
    - **Low Discount**: Higher profit.
    - **High Discount**: Lower profit.

    - **Conclusion**: The hypothesis is confirmed. High discounts lead to lower profit margins, and vice versa.

    ### Conclusion
    This analysis highlights the importance of finding a balanced discount strategy. Medium discounts are most effective in generating sales, while high discounts, although effective, could reduce profit margins.

    <kbd><img src="images/11_simulatingbudgetallocation.png"> </kbd> <br>
        Fig.11. Simulating Budget Allocation
    </p>
        
    #### Output Overview
    The results of our analysis are presented in three columns:
    1. **Estimated Unit Sold**: The projected number of units to be produced.
    2. **Average Manufacturing Price**: The average cost to manufacture each unit.
    3. **Estimated Manufacturing Budget**: The total budget required for manufacturing.

    #### Calculation Details
    1. **Assumption**:
    - We plan to produce **290 units**.
    - The **average manufacturing price** per unit is **$10**.

    2. **Calculation**:
    - To estimate the manufacturing budget, we multiply the number of units by the average manufacturing price.
    - **Formula**: \( 290 \text{ units} \times \$10 \text{ per unit} = \$2,900 \).

    Thus, the estimated manufacturing budget for this particular product is **$2,900**.

    ### Conclusion
    That's the breakdown of the estimated manufacturing budget based on the given assumptions. This calculation provides a clear understanding of the financial requirements for production.
