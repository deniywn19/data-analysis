### **Statistics and Excel: Hamlet, Harry Potter, and Data Analysis**

---

#### **Introduction**
In this session, we explore how **statistics and Excel** can be used to analyze and organize data, even in creative fields like literature. Using examples from **Shakespeare's Hamlet** and **Harry Potter**, we’ll demonstrate how data can be structured, visualized, and interpreted to extract meaningful insights.

### **Key Tools and Resources**
1. **OneNote and Excel Integration**  
   - Access the online OneNote (icon on the left-hand side) for presentations, including **Presentation 10: Hamlet, Harry Potter, and Statistics**.  
   - Transcripts are being uploaded to OneNote, allowing you to use the **Immersive Reader Tool** to read or listen in your preferred language.  
   - The desktop version of OneNote is recommended for the best experience.

### **Organizing Data for Meaningful Insights**
1. **Different Data, Different Tools**  
   - Depending on the type of data and objectives, different tools and methods are used to organize and analyze it.  
   - Sorting data in various ways provides multiple perspectives, leading to a fuller understanding.

2. **Multiple Angles for a Fuller Picture**  
   - While some perspectives may carry more weight, combining multiple angles ensures a more comprehensive view of the data.

### **Case Study: Shakespeare’s Hamlet**
1. **Word Frequency Analysis**  
   - We extracted and listed all the words in *Hamlet* along with their frequency of use.  
   - This creates a dataset where each word is paired with its count, providing a quantitative view of the play.

        | Words     | Word Count |
        | --------- | ---------- |
        | lord      | 228        |
        | good      | 123        |
        | love      | 83         |
        | father    | 70         |
        | man       | 70         |
        | king      | 67         |
        | time      | 56         |
        | think     | 52         |
        | look      | 49         |
        | heaven    | 45         |
        | mad(ness) | 44         |
        | night     | 42         |
        | mother    | 41         |
        | god       | 40         |
        | soul      | 40         |
        | eye       | 39         |
        | death     | 38         |
        | play      | 36         |
        | world     | 36         |
        | hear      | 35         |

2. **The Importance of Word Order**  
   - The genius of Shakespeare lies not just in word selection but also in the **order** of words.  
   - Randomly arranging words wouldn’t produce a coherent play, highlighting the importance of structure in data.

3. **Extracting Meaning from Word Frequency**  
   - By analyzing the most frequently used words (e.g., "Lord"), we can infer themes or settings (e.g., a courtly environment).  
   - This approach is useful in fields like **literature** and **rhetoric**, where understanding word usage **and rhetorical devices can enhance writing skills.

        | Words     | Word Count |
        | --------- | ---------- |
        | **LORD**  | **228**    |
        | good      | 123        |
        | love      | 83         |

4. **Authorship Attribution**  
   - Word frequency analysis can also help determine authorship. For example, scholars use this method to identify who wrote certain biblical texts or the Federalist Papers.  
   - By comparing word usage and rhetorical patterns, we can make educated guesses about authorship.

### **Sorting and Visualizing Data**
1. **Sorting Data**  
   - The first step in analyzing data is often sorting it, either alphabetically or by frequency (highest to lowest or vice versa).  
   - For *Hamlet*, sorting words by frequency helps identify the most significant terms.
        | Words     | Word Count |
        | --------- | ---------- |
        | lord      | 228        |
        | good      | 123        |
        | love      | 83         |
        | father    | 70         |
        | man       | 70         |
        | king      | 67         |
        | time      | 56         |
        | think     | 52         |
        | look      | 49         |
        | heaven    | 45         |
        | mad(ness) | 44         |
        | night     | 42         |
        | mother    | 41         |
        | god       | 40         |
        | soul      | 40         |
        | eye       | 39         |
        | death     | 38         |
        | play      | 36         |
        | world     | 36         |
        | hear      | 35         |

2. **Creating Visual Representations**  
   - **Bar Charts**: A standard tool in Excel for visualizing word frequency.  
     - The **x-axis** lists the words, and the **y-axis** shows their frequency.  
     - For example, the word "Lord" appears 228 times, while "look" appears 49 times.  
   - **Histograms**: Used for numerical data, histograms group data into bins, providing a different perspective on distribution.

3. **Why Visuals Matter**  
   - Visual representations aren’t just for simplification; they offer a new angle for understanding data.  
   - For complex datasets, visuals are often the only way to grasp patterns and relationships.

### **Case Study: Harry Potter**


1. **Word Frequency in Harry Potter**  
   - We analyzed the most frequently used words in the *Harry Potter* series.  
   - Initial analysis included common words like "and," "the," and "to," which may not provide meaningful insights.

        **Most Frequently Used Words in the Series**

        | Word  | Frequency |
        | ----- | --------- |
        | the   | 51593     |
        | and   | 27430     |
        | to    | 26985     |
        | of    | 21802     |
        | a     | 20966     |
        | he    | 20322     |
        | harry | 16557     |
        | was   | 15631     |
        | said  | 14398     |
        | his   | 14264     |

2. **Refining the Data: Non-Stop Words**  
   - To extract more meaningful information, we filtered out **stop words** (common words like "and," "the").  
   - This refined dataset focuses on significant words like character names (e.g., "Ron," "Hermione," "Dumbledore") and key terms (e.g., "wand," "time").

        **Displaying Frequency of Non "Stop Words" in the Whole Series**

        | Word       | Frequency |
        | ---------- | --------- |
        | harry      | 16557     |
        | ron        | 5750      |
        | hermione   | 4912      |
        | dumbledore | 2873      |
        | looked     | 2344      |
        | professor  | 2006      |
        | hagrid     | 1732      |
        | time       | 1713      |
        | wand       | 1639      |
        | eyes       | 1604      |

3. **Visualizing Harry Potter Data**  
   - A bar chart was created to display the frequency of non-stop words.  
   - The chart was customized for visual appeal, with colors and orientation adjusted to enhance readability.
